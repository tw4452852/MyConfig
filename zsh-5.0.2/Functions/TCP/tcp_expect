# Expect one of a series of regular expressions from $TCP_SESS.
# Can make backreferences to be handled by $match.  Returns 0 for
# successful match, 1 for error, 2 for timeout.
#
# This function has no facility for conditionally calling code based
# the regular expression found.  This should be done in the calling code
# by testing $TCP_LINE, which contains the line which matched the
# regular expression.  The complete set of lines read while waiting for
# this line is available in the array $tcp_expect_lines (including $TCP_LINE
# itself which will be the final element).  Alternatively, use -p pind
# which sets $pind to the index of the pattern which matched.  It
# will be set to 0 otherwise.
#
# Many of the options are passed straight down to tcp_read.
#
# Options:
#   -a     Run tcp_expect across all sessions; the first pattern matched
#          from any session is used.  The TCP output prompt can be
#          used to decide which session matched.
#   -l list
#          Comma-separated list of sessions as for tcp_read.
#   -p pv  If the Nth of a series of patterns matches, set the parameter
#          whose name is given by $pv to N; in the case of a timeout,
#          set it to -1; otherwise (unless the function exited prematurely),
#	   set it to 0.
#	   To avoid namespace clashes, the parameter's name must
#	   not begin with `_expect'.
#   -q     Quiet, passed down to tcp_read.  Bad option and argument
#          usage is always reported.
#   -s sess
#          Expect from session sess.  May be repeated for multiple sessions.
#   -t to  Timeout in seconds (may be floating point) per read operation.
#          tcp_expect will only time out if every read operation takes longer
#          than to
#   -T TO  Overall timeout; tcp_expect will time out if the overall operation
#          takes longer than this many seconds.
